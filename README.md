## Hi there 👋

- 📚 I am currently a student in Professor Krisel's INAFU6502: Intro to Text Analysis in Python course at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs
- 👩🏻‍⚖️ At SIPA, I am studying for my Master's in Public Administration with a Concentration in Human Rights and Humanitarian Studies and a Specialization in Technology, Media, and Communications
- 👩🏻‍💻 In this course, I am looking to build foundational knowledge in Python! I am interested in learning this new language and finding ways that will make learning other coding languages easier
- ⛷️ My hobbies include skiing, running, hiking, reading and writing, and painting and drawing
- 👩🏻‍🎓 A fun fact about me is that I received my undergraduate degree in December 2023, 6 months early!
